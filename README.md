ALEXCollectionView
==================

An experiment to use Cocoa Autolayout to create a CollectionView on OS X that works more closely to a view based NSTableView, using traditional protocols for DataSource and Delegate instead of the approaches that NSCollectionView and IKImageBrowser take. (Note: Not a subclass of NSCollectionView and not a drop in replacement either.)

Status: work in progress, not ready for production yet.
